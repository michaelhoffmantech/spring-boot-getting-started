# 1 - Introduction

Hi, I'm Michael Hoffman. All the details from my presentation can be found here in this repository. 

Some highlights of my background:

* I author for Pluralsight.com. Pluralsight provides online technical training courses on almost every topic you can imagine. Content is produced by some of the top authors in the industry and comes at a reasonable monthly price. 
* I work for NVISIA based out of Chicago and Milwaukee. We are a consultancy providing product development, legacy modernization, IT strategy and agile strategy services. Our primary focus is on Java-based solutions. 
* I've been working with Spring Boot since it was first released in 2014 and watched it grow and mature over the past three years from an unknown framework to a leader in providing rapid development of server-based applications, especially in the realm of REST-based microservices.
